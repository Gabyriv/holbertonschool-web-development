## Project Structure
- `index.html` - The main HTML structure of the website
- `styles.css` - The CSS file containing all styling for the website
- `photos/` - Directory containing all images used in the website

## Design Implementation
The website is divided into several key sections, each carefully styled to match the Figma design specifications:

### Header Section
- Logo and navigation menu
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Hero Section
- "Get schooled" headline with button
- "Learn from the pros" section with profile images

### Quote Section
- Purple background with testimonial 
- Author information with image

### Most Popular Tutorials Section

- Registration button with call to action

### FAQ Section
- Frequently asked questions in a 2x2 grid layout
- Styled question and answer typography

### Footer Section

## CSS Features Implemented
- CSS variables for consistent color and typography
- Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Responsive design techniques
- Proper use of CSS selectors and specificity
- Background images and overlays
- Hover effects and transitions

## Requirements
### General

- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- You are **not allowed** to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
- Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with `W3C-Validator`

## Project Outcome
The final result is a pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma design with clean, maintainable CSS code that adheres to best practices. The website is fully responsive and maintains visual consistency across different sections.
