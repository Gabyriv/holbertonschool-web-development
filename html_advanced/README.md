# HTML, Advanced

## Project Overview

This project implements the HTML structure for the "Smile School" website, following a designer file. The focus is on creating a well-structured HTML document without any CSS or JavaScript - just pure semantic HTML markup that will serve as the foundation for later styling.

## Requirements

### General

- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- You are **not allowed** to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
- Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with `W3C-Validator`

## Usage

To view the website:

Note: This is only the HTML structure - no styles have been applied yet. The visual appearance will be implemented in subsequent projects with CSS.

## Future Improvements

- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
- Add JavaScript functionality for interactive elements
